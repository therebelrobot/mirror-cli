A node utility to manually clone Github repositories. *with bonus CLI!*

 Github, by design, restricts the number of times you can fork a repo into a single account. Even then, after forking, you are bound to the upstream in your repo page, which if you are doing an iterative work can sometimes be a hinderance to marketing. There are [hacks](https://adrianshort.org/create-multiple-forks-of-a-github-repo/) and [workarounds](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/) for this, but **mirror** allows you to manually clone a repo with a single command.

## Installation

```bash
npm i -g mirror-cli
```

## Usage

To use mirror, you'll need to generate a Github Personal Access Token, [found here](https://github.com/settings/tokens). You should only grant this token the permissions it needs, which is ***repo***. (If you discover it needs other permissions besides that, lemme know)

### CLI

```bash
mirror account/repo to other-account/other-repo -u username -t token
```

If you add your username and token to your environment under the variables `GITHUB_USER` and `GITHUB_TOKEN`, the command below will do the same thing:

```bash
mirror account/repo to other-account/other-repo
```

If you want to create the new repo from scratch, just add the flag `--create` or `-c`

```
Usage:
  mirror [OPTIONS] [ARGS]

Options:
  -u, --user [STRING]    Your Github Username (Default is username-from-environment)
  -t, --token [STRING]   Your Github Access Token (Default is token-from-environment)
  -f, --force BOOL       force push target branch
  -c, --create BOOL      create target repo on Github
  -k, --no-color         Omit color from output
      --debug            Show debug information
  -v, --version          Display the current version
  -h, --help             Display help and usage details
```
